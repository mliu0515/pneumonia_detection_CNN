# pneumonia_detection_CNN

This project is my attempt to learn about convolutional neural network (CNN). 

Acquired from Kaggle, this dataset consists of Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) of pediatric patients with or without pneumonia. 

Using data augmentation and CNN, I am able to train the modle to detect pneumonia from these X-ray images.
